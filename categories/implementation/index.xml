While the Attack Flow Builder from MITRE was originally designed to visualize and model cyber operations based on the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework, I needed to go a step further for my research in space cybersecurity.
The challenge: how to integrate SPARTA (a cybersecurity framework for space systems) into the Attack Flow Builder so that we can model attacks not only in traditional IT/OT contexts, but also in the space domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
