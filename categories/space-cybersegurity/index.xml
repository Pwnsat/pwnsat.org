While the Attack Flow Builder from MITRE was originally designed to visualize and model cyber operations based on the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework, I needed to go a step further for my research in space cybersecurity.
The challenge: how to integrate SPARTA (a cybersecurity framework for space systems) into the Attack Flow Builder so that we can model attacks not only in traditional IT/OT contexts, but also in the space domain.</description></item><item><title>Lessons from the Viasat Cyberattack: A SPARTA Framework Analysis</title><link>/blog/lessons-from-the-viasat-cyberattack-a-sparta-framework-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/lessons-from-the-viasat-cyberattack-a-sparta-framework-analysis/</guid><description>In February 2022, one of the most notable cyber incidents in the space sector took place: the Viasat KA-SAT cyberattack. This event disrupted satellite communications across Europe, affecting both civilian and military users. For the cybersecurity and space communities, the incident stands as a turning point, highlighting how vulnerable the ground and user segments of space systems can be when targeted with coordinated cyber operations.
In this post, Iâ€™ll walk through a simplified analysis of the attack using the SPARTA framework, which is specifically designed for threats against space systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
